# ``HOST_IP`` should be set manually for best results if the NIC configuration
# of the host is unusual, i.e. ``eth1`` has the default route but ``eth0`` is the
# public interface.  It is auto-detected in ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate
# on later runs due to the IP moving from an Ethernet interface to a bridge on
# the host. Setting it here also makes it available for ``openrc`` to include
# when setting ``OS_AUTH_URL``.
